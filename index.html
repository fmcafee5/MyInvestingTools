        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Finlay McAfee and I am a rising sophomore at Occidental College with a keen interest in the stock market. I am actively involved in the Occidental College Blyth Fund, which manages a 6-figure investment portfolio. Through this experience, I am gaining valuable insights and starting my journey into the world of finance. I have curated a selection of resources, including top books, podcasts, and tools, to better educate myself on stocks, investing, and financial management. These resources have been instrumental in helping me build a strong foundation in finance and investing, and I believe they can be just as beneficial for you.</p>
